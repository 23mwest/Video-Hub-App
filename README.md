# Introduction

VideoHub is built on top of `angular-electron` 1.9.0 but has been updated since then.

It was built off

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/maximegris/angular-electron.git
```

Currently runs with:

- Angular v5.1.1
- Angular-CLI v1.6.1
- Electron v1.7.8
- Electron Builder v19.49.0

Works with:

- Node v8.9.4
- npm v5.6.0

## To build for development

`npm start`

The application code is managed by `main.ts`. You can desactivate "Developer Tools" by commenting `win.webContents.openDevTools();` in `main.ts`.

## To build for production

- Using development variables (environments/index.ts) :  `npm run electron:dev`
- Using production variables (environments/index.prod.ts) :  `npm run electron:prod`

Your built files are in the /dist folder.

## Included Commands

|Command|Description|
|--|--|
|`npm run start:web`| Execute the app in the brower |
|`npm run electron:linux`| Builds your application and creates an app consumable on linux system |
|`npm run electron:windows`| On a Windows OS, builds your application and creates an app consumable in windows 32/64 bit systems |
|`npm run electron:mac`|  On a MAC OS, builds your application and generates a `.app` file of your application that can be run on Ma |

**Your application is optimised. Only the files of /dist folder are included in the executable.**

## Use NodeJS Native libraries

Actually Angular-Cli doesn't seem to be able to import nodeJS native libs or electron libs at compile time (Webpack error). This is (one of) the reason why webpack.config was ejected of ng-cli.
If you need to use NodeJS native libraries, you **MUST** add it manually in the file `webpack.config.js` in root folder :

```javascript
  "externals": {
    "electron": 'require(\'electron\')',
    "child_process": 'require(\'child_process\')',
    "fs": 'require(\'fs\')'
    ...
  },
```

Notice that all NodeJS v7 native libs are already added in this sample. Feel free to remove those you don't need.

## Browser mode

Maybe you want to execute the application in the browser (WITHOUT HOT RELOAD ACTUALLY...) ? You can do it with `npm run start:web`.  
Note that you can't use Electron or NodeJS native libraries in this case. Please check `providers/electron.service.ts` to watch how conditional import of electron/Native libraries is done.
